# Token-bruteforcer

This is a python script that does the same as a token forgery attack using burpsuites sequencer or intruder. 
You don't have to have pro to use it for more than twenty tells at a weak token distro.

You have to have done the start sequencer part prior to using this and got your 20x200 or anything over 0 out if 20 use this.

Each token takes about a second to process. 
Max number of tries in one go was 218,000 and this took half a day to complete but gave me 7 tokens that worked and, 1 was an account with basic privileges enough to download scripts and run them to escalate to an account with admin privileges. 

I then didn't have root but could delegate it ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£. To create an account and security group as an admin and then set myself a nice user with full root privileges and a walk to root with a 
sudo su root no password.
